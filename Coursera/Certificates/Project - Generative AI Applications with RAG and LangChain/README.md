# Project: Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain [üîó](https://coursera.org/share/5a9e7af0410cfbf681e566a9b9725b7c)

Turning knowledge into action ‚Äî this hands-on project brought together the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain to design, build, and deploy a functional generative AI application.

## üìö Project Overview

In this capstone-style project, I applied advanced concepts of generative AI to create an end-to-end application using RAG and LangChain. The project focused on combining large language models with external knowledge sources to produce dynamic, contextually accurate AI responses.

## üß† Key Skills Demonstrated

- Designing RAG-based generative AI architectures  
- Implementing multi-step agent workflows using LangChain  
- Connecting LLMs to external data via vector stores  
- Building and managing chains for reasoning and data retrieval  
- Prompt engineering and evaluation for real-time interaction  
- Deploying and testing a complete generative AI application

## üåç Real-World Applications

The project experience translates directly to:

- Developing enterprise-grade AI assistants with live knowledge access  
- Creating smart customer support bots and internal tools  
- Enhancing decision-making systems with contextual intelligence  
- Prototyping innovative AI products powered by RAG workflows  
- Accelerating development in AI-driven search and recommendation systems

This project was a culmination of my learning ‚Äî a practical showcase of how to engineer intelligent, data-aware AI applications using RAG and LangChain.
